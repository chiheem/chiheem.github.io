          <p>Hi! I am a Computer Scientist developing artificial intelligence (A.I.) and data science tools and applying
            them to a myraid of real-world problems in finance, supply-chain, and other areas. My current projects involve
            creating and evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) agents, and separately, developing new Graph Neural Network 
            (GNN) architectures.</p>

          <p>I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at Hitachi America, Ltd. I am also a visiting scholar
            at the Stanford Computer Science Department working on LLMs with Percy Liang and a research
            affiliate at the MIT Laboratory for Financial Engineering (LFE).</p>

          <p>I hold a B.Eng (First Class Honors) in Mechanical Engineering and a B.SocSci (First Class Honors) in
            Economics from the National University of Singapore, as well as an S.M. and a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering
            and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My doctorate thesis was advised by
            Andrew W. Lo.</p>
