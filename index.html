          <p>Hi! I develop artificial intelligence and data science tools and apply them to a myriad of real-world 
            problems in finance, supply-chain, and other areas. My current research involve evaluating foundation models
            such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), creating generative AI agents,
            and developing new Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures and physics-based neural networks.</p>

          <p>I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at Hitachi America, Ltd. I am also a visiting scholar
            at the Stanford Computer Science Department working on LLM-related research with Percy Liang.</p>

          <p>I hold a B.Eng (First Class Honors) in Mechanical Engineering and a B.SocSci (First Class Honors) in
            Economics from the National University of Singapore, as well as an S.M. and a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering
            and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My doctorate thesis was advised by
            Andrew W. Lo.</p>
